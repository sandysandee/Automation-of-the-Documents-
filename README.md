Project Overview
This project showcases various automation scripts designed to streamline and simplify repetitive tasks. Using Python, the project demonstrates automated processes for data handling, task scheduling, and other workflows that can save time and reduce manual work.

Key Features
Task Automation: Includes scripts to automate repetitive tasks, enhancing productivity and efficiency.
Data Processing: Automates data extraction, transformation, and loading processes (ETL), utilizing libraries such as Pandas for data handling.
Scheduling and Execution: Leverages Pythonâ€™s scheduling libraries to set up tasks that run periodically.
Libraries Used:
Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and processing.
Schedule for task scheduling.
OS and shutil for file and directory operations.
Other Libraries (specific to the tasks within the notebook).
Project Structure
Automations.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for each automation task.
data/: Directory for storing input and output data files.
scripts/: Folder for standalone automation scripts, if applicable.
logs/: Folder for log files, recording the status and results of automation tasks.
Prerequisites
Python 3.10.9 (or compatible version)
Required Libraries: Install libraries listed in requirements.txt:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Installation and Setup
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/sandysandee/automation-project.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd automation-project
Install Required Packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Automations
Open the Automations.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook.
Run the notebook cells in sequence to execute each automation task.
For standalone scripts in the scripts/ directory, run each script from the command line:
bash
Copy code
python scripts/your_script_name.py
Usage
Each automation script is designed for specific tasks, from data processing to periodic task execution. Detailed comments are included in the notebook to guide you through the purpose and functionality of each cell.
